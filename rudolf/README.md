# Example for "Data driven" Locations

Loading Locations from JSON Data would make:

- code maintenance easier (ok at first its a bit more complicated)
- Notation of Location Data would be more flexible (all what you can do in json)
- Location Data could be added in advance, Features could be implemented later
- Location Data could be reused (for example for showing Maps on the website)
  - We write once, use it multiple times
